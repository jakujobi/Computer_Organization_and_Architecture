- Talked about the bridge of hardware and software


# Class 2 - Comp Abstractinos & Technology

Things that affect performance

- **Algorithm:** Number of operations executed
- **Programming language, compiler, architecture:** Number of instructions executed per operation
- **Processor and memory system:** How fast the instructions are executed
- **I/o system (including OS):** determines how fast I/O operations are executed

## Eigth Great Ideas
- Design for Moore's Law
- Use abstraction to simplify design
- Make the common case fast: Focus more efficiency in its common case
- Performance via parallelism
- Performance via pipelining
- Performance via prediction
- Hierarchy of memories
- Dependability via redundancy
- 
### Below our program
- Application software: Written in high level language
  - High level language - C, C++, Java, Python
    - Level of abstraction closer to the problem domain
    - Provides a high level view of the problem, productivity and portability
- System software
    - Compiler: Translates High level language to low level and machine code
      - Assembly Language: Textual representation of instructions
    - Operating system: service code
      - Handles input and output
      - Handles memory management, storage, and system calls
      - Scheduling tasks & shared resources
- Hardware: Processor, memory, I/O controllers
  - We will learn how to make the decisions in hardware
  - Hardware representation: Binary digits (bit)
    - Encoded instructions and data

### Components of a Computer
- I/O Input and output:
  - Storage devices
  - Network adapters: Connects computers together
  - User-interface devices: Keyboard, mouse, harddrive
- Memory
- Processor

### Video memory
- Where a program writes to for what to display
- Frame buffer

## CSC 317 cover
- Hardware Software interface
- Hardware
- Software

## What is Computer Architecture
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- The interface or boundary between hardware and software
- The hardware's specifications


### Abstractions
- Abstraction helps us deal with complexity
    - hide lower level detail
